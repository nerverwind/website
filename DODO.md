## 1.About DODO
DODO is a decentralized exchange platform powered by the Proactive Market Maker (PMM) algorithm. It features highly capital-efficient liquidity pools that support single-token provision, reduce impermanent loss, and minimize slippage for traders. The trading platform also offers SmartTrade, a decentralized liquidity aggregation service that routes to and compares various liquidity sources to quote the optimal prices between any two tokens. In addition, DODO removed all roadblocks hindering liquidity pool creation for the issuance of new assets - asset ratios, liquidity depths, fee rates, and other parameters can all be freely customized and configured in real-time. Based on this breakthrough, DODO has developed Crowdpooling, a permissionless, equal opportunity liquidity offering mechanic, as well as customizable technical solutions geared towards professional on-chain market makers.

## 2.Key Highlights
**SmartTrade trading and aggregation**

Built on Ethereum and BSC, DODO enables trading between two arbitrary tokens on the same network, with SmartTrade intelligently finding the best order routing from aggregated liquidity sources to give traders the best prices. 

**Crowdpooling**

An equal opportunity way to distribute tokens and kick-off liquidity markets. Crowdpooling attempts to eliminate the chances of front-running or bot interference. 

**Pools**

Pools give liquidity providers the flexibility to create and manage their own on-chain market making strategies in a fully permissionless, non-custodial manner. Mining: DODO platform users can earn DODO token rewards by engaging in liquidity mining, trade mining, and Combiner Harvest mining, which are geared towards liquidity providers, traders, and pool creators respectively.
